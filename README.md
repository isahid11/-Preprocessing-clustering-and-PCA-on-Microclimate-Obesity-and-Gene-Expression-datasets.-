# Preprocessing-clustering-and-PCA-on-Microclimate-Obesity-and-Gene-Expression-datasets.

Data Preprocessing, Clustering & PCA
Overview
This project covers data preprocessing, clustering, and dimensionality reduction as part of the SIG720 coursework.
It works with three datasets:

Microclimate – for missing value handling and scaling.

Obesity – for clustering and categorical encoding.

Gene Expression – for PCA and high-dimensional data analysis.

Steps Performed
Handled missing values using mean/median imputation.

Extracted latitude/longitude from location strings.

Applied Min–Max scaling and compared data distributions before and after scaling.

Encoded categorical features for clustering.

Found optimal clusters using Silhouette Coefficient.

Compared KMeans and KMeans++ algorithms.

Applied PCA to reduce features and compared clustering results before and after PCA.

Tools Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn
